----CLR handles program execution for various languages including C#. The architecture of CLR handles memory management, garbage collection, security handling

3. What is garbage collection in C#?
----Garbage collection is the process of freeing up memory that is captured by unwanted objects. When you create a class object, automatically some memory space
     is allocated to the object in the heap memory.

 C) Protected- When a method defined as protected, it can be accessed only within that class and the one inheriting the class.

 D) Internal- When a method is defined as internal, then it will be accessed from that class at the current assembly position.

 E) Protected Internal- When a method as protected internal, then it’s access restricted to classes within the current project
                        assembly or different types defined by that class.

    2)Readonly: We can change the value during runtime and it is posible only through the non-static constructor.

56. Can “this” be used within a static method? 
----We can't use 'this' in a static method because the keyword 'this' returns a reference to the current instance of the class
    so, Static methods can exist without creating an instance of the class.

57. What is the difference between the dispose and finalize methods in C#?
----1) Dispose: It is used to free unmanaged resources that are not in use by explicitly called.
    2) Finalize: It is used to free unmanaged resources that are not in use by implicitly called.

58. What is filters and its types?

    Filters: Check the Authorization,  and preventing access to resources for Unauthorized users.

    1. Authorization filters: Run first and are used to determine whether the user is authorized for the request. 
    2. Resource filters: This runs code before model binding.
    3. Action filters: This runs immediately before and after an action method is called.
       --Here we can change the arguments passed into an action and Are not supported in Razor Pages.
    4. Exception filters: It handle the exceptions that occur before the response.
    5. Result filters:  This run code immediately before and after the execution of action results. They run only when the action method has executed successfully.
